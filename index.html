        <p>GreenWall is a World of Warcraft Addon that allows multiple guilds to share guild chat as if they were one guild.  When a member in one guild types something in guild chat, members of the other connected guilds will see what was said and can respond.</p>

<p>GreenWall is similar to other addons like <a href="http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/guild2guild">Guild2Guild</a>, but it meets different design goals.</p>

<ul>
<li>Any member can use GreenWall without any configuration beyond the initial installation.  All of the configuration work is done by the guild officers.</li>
<li>No one member functions as a gateway for the guild chat traffic, thus no member is burdened with more processing than any other member and the system doesn't break when "trusted" members aren't logged in.</li>
<li>The additional amount of processing is minimal.</li>
</ul><p>Meeting these design goals does have a few requirements.</p>

<ul>
<li>All members must have at least one spare custom chat channel available (two for officers if officer chat is also being bridged).</li>
<li>You must use the Guild Info screen for the configuration.</li>
<li>The configuration must be identical for all guilds on the "confederation".</li>
<li>The configuration may be a little intimidating for non-IT types.  But there is a <a href="https://github.com/AIE-Guild/GreenWall/blob/master/GUILD_QUICKSTART.md">Quick Start Guide</a> for guild officers.</li>
