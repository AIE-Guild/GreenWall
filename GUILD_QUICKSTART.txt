1)  Definitions
---------------

Bridging:
    Replication of chat events within one guild into the guild, achievement,
    and officer chat of another guild.

Confederation: 
    A large WoW guild that is partitioned into smaller guilds to comply
    with Blizzard's guild size limit.

Container Guild or Co-Guild:
    One of the component members of a guild confederation.

Officer:
    A member of any of the co-guilds within a confederation who can view
    officer notes for members.


2)  Bridging Guild Chat
-----------------------

All configuration for general guild chat is stored in the "Guild Information"
field in the "Guild" window (J).  The block of configuration text will be 
read by GreenWall on the member machines.  The benefit of this approach is
that a member can join and use GreenWall without having to perform any
special configuration.

All configuration directives use the following format.

    GW:x:arglist

The "x" is substituted with a specific opcode and the "arglist" portion is a 
colon separated list of arguments.

    *   Required Configuration

        *   Common Channel

            GW:c:name:password

        This specifies the custom chat channel to use for all general 
        confederation bridging.

        
        *   Peer Co-Guild

            GW:p:guild_name:tag

        You must specify one of these directives for each co-guild in the 
        confederation, INCLUDING THE CO_GUILD YOU ARE CONFIGURING.

        Additionally, the "guild_name" must be match the name of the guild
        exactly and the tag (a short nickname that will be shown if the member
        enables tagging) must be the same in all of the configurations across
        the co-guilds.


    *   Optional Configuration

        *   Minimum Version

            GW:mv:x.y.z

        This disables the GreenWall client if the member is running a version
        prior to version x.y.z.


    *   Example

        GW:c:topSekritChan:pencil
        GW:o:mv=1.1.00
        GW:p:Darkmoon Clan:DMC
        GW:p:Baseball Dandies:BBD
        GW:p:Nightlife:NL
        

2)  Bridging Officer Chat
-----------------------

    *   Configuration

        There is only a single configuration directive for officer chat.  It
        is stored in the officer note of the guild leader.

            GW:a:name:password
        
        This specifies the custom chat channel to use for bridging of the
        officer chat among co-guilds.

        By default, officer chat bridging is disabled in the client.  To
        participate across co-guilds, an officer will need to issue the
        following command and make sure that officer chat is enabled in one of
        the chat windows.

            /greenwall ochat on


    *   Example

        GW:a:secretSquirrels:rosebud
