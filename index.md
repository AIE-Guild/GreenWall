GreenWall is a World of Warcraft Addon that allows multiple guilds to share guild chat as if they were one guild.  When a member in one guild types something in guild chat, members of the other connected guilds will see what was said and can respond.

GreenWall is similar to other addons like [Guild2Guild](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/guild2guild), but it meets different design goals.

* Any member can use GreenWall without any configuration beyond the initial installation.  All of the configuration work is done by the guild officers.
* No one member functions as a gateway for the guild chat traffic, thus no member is burdened with more processing than any other member and the system doesn't break when "trusted" members aren't logged in.
* The additional amount of processing is minimal.

Meeting these design goals does have a few requirements.

* All members must have at least one spare custom chat channel available (two for officers if officer chat is also being bridged).
* You must use the Guild Info screen for the configuration.
* The configuration must be identical for all guilds on the "confederation".
* The configuration may be a little intimidating for non-IT types.  But there is a [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/AIE-Guild/GreenWall/blob/master/GUILD_QUICKSTART.md) for guild officers.
